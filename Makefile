# T3Claw – convenience wrapper around docker compose.
#
# Usage:
#   make up              – start the full stack including t3n-mcp sidecar (detached)
#   make build           – build / rebuild all images including t3n-mcp sidecar
#   make rebuild         – build then restart (use after code changes)
#   make up-no-t3n       – start stack without the t3n-mcp sidecar (no trinity needed)
#   make build-no-t3n    – build without the t3n-mcp sidecar
#   make rebuild-no-t3n  – build without sidecar then restart
#   make down            – stop containers, keep volumes
#   make wipe            – stop containers AND delete all volumes (full reset)
#   make restart         – restart only the t3claw service
#   make logs            – follow t3claw logs
#   make shell           – open a shell inside the running container
#   make status          – show running container state
#   make help            – print this list

# ── Docker socket GID detection ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# The t3claw container needs to join the group that owns the Docker socket
# so sandbox jobs can spawn worker containers.
#
# macOS Docker Desktop: the socket lives inside a VM and is not stat-able from
#   the host, so the fallbacks below return 0 (root group), which is what
#   Docker Desktop maps the socket to inside containers.
# Linux VPS: stat -c %g returns the docker group GID (often 998–999).
#
# The value is exported so docker compose picks it up via ${DOCKER_GID:-0}
# in docker-compose.yml — no manual .env editing required.
DOCKER_GID := $(shell stat -c %g /var/run/docker.sock 2>/dev/null \
                    || stat -f %g /var/run/docker.sock 2>/dev/null \
                    || echo 0)
export DOCKER_GID

COMPOSE     := docker compose --profile app --profile mcp
